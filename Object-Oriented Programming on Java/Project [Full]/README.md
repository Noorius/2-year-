# The Game

## Introduction
> The purpose of the whole project is to provide you with the opportunity to review some of the ideas and techniques you should be familiar with from this course, including file I/O, manipulation of arrays, and fundamental principles of object-oriented development.

## Project Requirements Overview
> You will be implementing a simple game simulation based on a 2D map where the user (player) can move in four main directions: right, left, up, and down. There is no GUI, but the aim is to design all the necessary components and structure them in a way so that it can serve as a base for some more specific game types
