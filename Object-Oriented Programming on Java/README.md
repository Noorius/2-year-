# CSE212 Object-Oriented programming and Design

## SYLLABUS

#### Course Goals:
>During the course student will obtain the knowledge of fundamental principles of Object-Oriented programming. In particular, he/she will become familiar with the concepts of classes, 
objects, interfaces, inheritance, nested and abstract classes, polymorphism and data 
encapsulation. Moreover, by the end of the course he/she will master basic Java constructs â€“ java 
collections (sets, lists, maps), exceptions, input / output, etc. The main goal to be achieved 
during this course is to be able to use a high-level object-oriented programming language as a 
problem-solving tool - including basic data structures and algorithms, object-oriented 
programming techniques, and software documentation

### Introduction
Java features. JVM. JRE. Java syntax. 
Java API. Variables. Programming
fundamentals. Intro to OOP.

### Objects and Classes
Class vs objects. UML. Constructors.
References.

### Objects and Classes
Data fields and methods. Primitive vs
Reference types. Java library classes.

### Objects and Classes
Instance vs static fields.
Encapsulation. Array of objects. 
Scopes. this keyword.

###  Object-Oriented Thinking 
Class abstraction. Procedural vs 
Object-oriented paradigms. Class 
relationships. Object-oriented design.

### Object-Oriented Thinking
Wrapper classes. String classes.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
Superclasses and subclasses. The 
super keyword. Overloading vs 
overriding.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism
Object class and its methods. 
Polymorphism and dynamic binding. 
ArrayList. protected and final
keywords.

### Exception Handling and Text I/O
Advantages. Error vs Exception. 
Throw, try, catch. File, PrintWriter, 
and Scanner classes.

### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Generalization. Defining interfaces 
and classes that implement interfaces. 
Comparable. Cloneable. 

### Generics
Benefits. Generic classes and 
interfaces. Generic methods. Raw 
types. Wildcards. Limitations. 

### Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Priority 
Queues
Collection interface. Iterator. 
ArrayList vs LinkedList. Comparable 
vs Comparator. Collections class.

### Sets and Maps
Set classes. Sets vs Lists. Collection 
vs Map.

### Implementing Lists, Stacks, 
Queues, and Priority Queues 
Designing an array list and a linked 
list. Implementing a stack and a 
queue.
